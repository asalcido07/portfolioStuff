							<h4>A Man Outside, A Beast Within</h4>

							<p>Patiently we awaited for a new character to arrive into Street Fighter V. Finally, a new fighter enters the battle! Necalli had been teased at the end of EVO2k15 (the largest fighting game tournament) when a trailer for M. Bison was revealed at the end of the event. Not much was known, other than he was possibly a Maori figher. However, after observing the trailer and photos, it appears he closely resembles an Aztec warrior more than anything.</p>

							<p>With drizzling dreads and his beastily nature, he's quite similar to Blanka. Although he differs greatly from the green wild man from Street Fighter II. For instance, one of Necalli's moves closely resembles Wolverine's Berserker Attack from the Marvel Vs. Capcom series. In addition, he has a command grab with an EX version that can be used to deal big damage. He appears to have an upppercut, which can be used for anti-air.</p>

							<p>It's also been brought up that once his V-Trigger has been activated, it runs throughout the course of the round. No other character has that, which can be problem. Nonetheless, Necalli is a welcomed addition to the Street Fighter universe and will fit right in.</p>
